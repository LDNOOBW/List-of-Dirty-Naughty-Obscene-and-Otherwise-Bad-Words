# List of dirty, naughty, obscene, and otherwise bad words in different languages #

Please add to it as you see fit (particularly in non-English languages) or use it to spice up your next game of Scrabble :)

Obvious warning: These lists contain material that many will find offensive.  (But that's the point!)

Miscellaneous caveat: Clearly, what goes in these lists is subjective.  In our case, the question we use is, "What wouldn't we want to *suggest* that people look at?"  This of course varies between culture, language, and geographies, so in the end we just have to make our best guess.
